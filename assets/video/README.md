# Background Video

Place your background video file here and name it `background.mp4`.

The video should be:
- A calming, looping animation (e.g., slow-moving landscape, abstract motion, or calm waves)
- In MP4 format for best browser compatibility
- Optimized for web (reasonable file size)
- Suitable for continuous looping without noticeable seams

If you don't have a video file, you can:
1. Use a free video from sites like Pexels or Pixabay
2. Create a simple animated background using CSS instead
3. Use a placeholder image temporarily
